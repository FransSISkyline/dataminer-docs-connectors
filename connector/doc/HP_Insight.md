# HP Insight

The **HP Insight** allows you to manage hardware across a wide variety of HP servers, including the latest HP ProLiant Gen8 Servers, as well as storage and networking products.

## About

This connector can be used to manage contracts and warranties, and to automate remote support via **HP Insight** Remote Support. It allows you to monitor the health of HP ProLiant Servers and HP Integrity Servers, and also provides you with basic support for non-HP servers. When you integrate HP SIM with HP Insight Control and the HP Matrix Operating Environment, you can proactively manage your physical and virtual server health, deploy servers quickly, decrease power consumption, and improve your infrastructure with capacity planning.
