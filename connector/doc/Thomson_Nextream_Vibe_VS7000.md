## Installation and configuration

### Creation

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and an HTTP connection. It requires the following input during element creation:

**SNMP CONNECTION**:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*

**SNMP Settings**:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private.*

**HTTP CONNECTION**:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
- **IP port**: The port of the destination, e.g. *80.*

### Configuration

Once the element has been created, the user credentials must still be filled in. To do so, go to the **General** page and click the **Credentials** page button.

## Usage

### General

This page displays the **Date and Time** of the device and the **Network Storage Table**.

Via the **Credentials** page button, you can fill in the username and password to access the device.

### Workflow

Via the **Parameters** page button, you can check the list of public WorkFlow parameters.

### Hardware

This page displays a **tree view** with relevant information structured according to **Node**, **Job** and **Job Parameter**.

From device firmware version 4.0.0.0 and connector version 1.1.0.1 onwards, this table has new parameters.

Via the **Job Information** page button, you can find more detailed information about each job on the device.

In version **1.1.0.x**, there is a **Custom Display Key** parameter that allows you to customize the Job Table's display key.

From version **1.1.1.5** onwards, a **Create Job** button is available, which starts a wizard that allows you to create and configure the WorkFlow that will be used for the job. The wizard uses the Automation script *Thomson_Nextream_Vibe_VS7000_New_Job.*

From version **1.1.1.6** onwards, a **Manage** button is available in the **Job Table**, which starts a wizard that allows you to configure the WorkFlow parameters that will be used for the job. The wizard uses the Automation script *Thomson_Nextream_Vibe_VS7000_Manage_Job.*
