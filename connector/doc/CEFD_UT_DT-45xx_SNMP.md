## About

### Version Info

| Range | Key Features | Based on | System Impact |
|--|--|--|--|
| 1.0.0.x | Initial version. | - | - |
| 1.0.1.x [SLC Main] | Force backup logic improved (see "How to Use"). | 1.0.0.6 | The Force backup parameter change has caused layout changes and parameter description changes, and parameters and a page button have been removed.<br>- SNMP parameter is now hidden (+ name changed) and a QAction is used to parse the information in order to display e.g. "Unit 01" instead of "01_Forced".<br>- The parameter to set this (including the button + logic) has been replaced with a dropdown menu containing all the available options. To create the information to be set on the hidden SNMP parameter, a QAction is now used. The parameter has also been renamed to match the SNMP parameter as it not only sets values but also displays current information. |

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.

- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *161*).

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).

- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

This connector uses SNMP parameters to access and modify the device.

The Force Backup feature functions differently depending on the range. In the current main range, a single dropdown menu lists all units, including the "None" option. When you select a unit in the dropdown, the switch will immediately be executed.

The display value is also different in the 1.0.1.x range. Where previously it would for instance show "01_FORCED", it will now show "Unit 01".
