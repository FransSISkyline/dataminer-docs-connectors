## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The **Device Type Table** contains the list of device types that can be monitored/controlled by the Crystal system. The **Device Presence** column indicates whether there is a supported device of that specific type in the system. If a device is present, its parameters can be displayed in a table based on the user requirements. In order to reduce the load on DataMiner, this table is not polled frequently.

When a new device is inserted in the system or when you want to update the displayed data, use the **Refresh Table** button.
