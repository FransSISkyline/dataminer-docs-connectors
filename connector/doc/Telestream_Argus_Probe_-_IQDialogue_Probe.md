# Telestream Argus Probe - IQDialogue Probe

With this connector, you can monitor video content streamed using adaptive bitrate technologies, both VoD and linear/live. This solution can passively monitor all video traffic over a multi-Gbps links. It provides publishing/origin and trans-network verification with both passive and active monitoring techniques. IQDialogue checks if content is available at caching sites and quickly notifies users of packaging errors, stale manifests, missing media chunks, and HTTP errors that could impact the viewer experience. Telestream's proprietary VeriStream metric (VS score) shows the QoS status for each video chunk of each stream.
