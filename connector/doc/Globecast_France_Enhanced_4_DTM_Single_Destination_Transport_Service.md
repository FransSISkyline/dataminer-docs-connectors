# Globecast France Enhanced 4 DTM Single Destination Transport Service

The Globecast France Enhanced 4 DTM Single Destination Transport Service is an enhanced service protocol. The protocol monitors four "Globecast France Enhanced DTM Channel" services, one "Globecast France Enhanced Conversion DTM Channel" and two Cobalt switches. It will collect the active alarms associated with these elements and determine the overall severity.

## Configuration

### Connections

This connector is an enhanced service protocol and uses a virtual connection. It can be applied to a service that includes four "Globecast France Enhanced DTM Channel" services, one "Globecast France Enhanced Conversion DTM Channel" and two Cobalt switches.

## How to use

On the **Service Status** page, the computed severity is displayed as the standalone parameter **Severity**. By activating alarm monitoring on this parameter only, you can align the calculated severity with the overall severity of the service.

The two tables on this same page illustrate the health of the nodes associated with the service. The **Service Alarms** table itemizes the active alarms, while the **Service Element Status** table provides a list of monitored general information.

## Notes

This enhanced service protocol was designed for a specific project and is not expected to be reused in general.
