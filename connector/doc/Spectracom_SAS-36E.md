- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private*.

### Polling Configuration

From version 1.0.0.12 onwards, a **Polling Configuration** page is available that allows you to define the polling intervals for the following groups of parameters:

- **Interfaces**
- **Status**

By default, polling for these groups is enabled, and the polling intervals for these groups are the same as in previous versions: 1 second for fast parameters, 1 minute for normal parameters, and 1 hour for slow parameters.

In the **Polling Table**, you can configure the intervals in the **Time** column, enable or disable the polling in the **State** column, and poll a specific group on demand in the **Refresh on Demand** column.
