## Configuration

### Creation

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private*. This will currently have no impact, as no write parameters have been implemented.
