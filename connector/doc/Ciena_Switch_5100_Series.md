# Ciena Switch 5100 Series

This connector monitors the activity of Ciena 5100 series switches. The Ciena 5000 family is part of a set of service aggregation switches. These switches provide aggregation to efficiently fill higher capacity links within both the metro access and aggregation tiers, minimizing the number of router assets required in the core.

The connector polls data from the device using SNMP. It supports different switch series. Depending on the device, it will display data on the corresponding device page.
