# Telestream Argus Probe - Surveyor ABR Probe

To check whether all adaptive bitrate (ABR) content is available at all times, the Surveyor ABR Probe is used for monitoring. It uses active monitoring to request the video content from various parts of the delivery network, allowing for rapid fault detection and troubleshooting. IneoQuest's proprietary VeriStream metric (VS Score) shows the QoS status for each video chunk of each stream.

This connector is automatically generated by the connector **Telestream Argus Probe**.
