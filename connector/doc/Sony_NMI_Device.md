## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element created with this connector has the following data pages:

- **General**: This page displays system information, including the **System Time**, **System Description**, **System Location**, **System Contact**, **System Up Time**, and other general parameters.
- **Network**: This page displays the **Interfaces** table. This table displays the operational status of the interfaces available in the workstation. This operational status can change based on incoming traps.
- **Product Information**: This page displays the **Product Information**, **Modules**, and **Remote Maintenance** tables.
- **Traps**: This page displays the **Traps Destination** table.
- **Alarms**: This page displays the **Error Status** table. This table is both polled and updated based on traps. The table is cleared when a "Coldstart" trap is received.
- **NMI**: This page contains specific NMI interface data such as **Protocol Version**, **System ID**, **Control Point ID**, **IP Checksum Errors**, **UDP Checksum Errors**, **TCP Checksum Errors**, **NMI Discard Packets**, and **NMI Checksum Last Change**.
  It also contains page buttons that provide access to additional NMI data.
