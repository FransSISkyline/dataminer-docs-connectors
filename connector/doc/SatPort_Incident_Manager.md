# SatPort Incident Manager

## About

The purpose of this connector is to listen to the ticketing application. When a new ticket is detected, the connector automatically attempts to forward it to iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service).

## Key Features

- **Ticket subscription**: The connector allows you to subscribe to specific ticket types via a configuration table. Only tickets of the selected types will be considered.

- **Automatic ticket forwarding**: If a ticket matches one of the subscribed types, it will be sent to iPaaS for further processing.
