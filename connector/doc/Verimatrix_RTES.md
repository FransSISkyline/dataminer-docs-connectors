# Verimatrix RTES

The **Verimatrix RTES** is a real-time encryption server. It provides real-time encryption of broadcast data.

Broadcast content is sent from a video server to the RTES using either a unicast or a multicast address. The RTES encrypts the data received on its source port and transmits it to a destination port.

## About

This connector uses **SNMP** to monitor the **Verimatrix RTES** device.
