## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

Fill in the **Username**, **Password** and **IP Address for Sessions.** If any of these parameters are empty or not valid, the connect request will not be executed and nothing will happen.

The **Debug Parameter** is disabled by default, so that debug pages are hidden. To view these pages, enable the parameter.

## How to use

The connector executes the logic daily or on demand when the **Update** button on the Elements page is pressed. When a valid Username, Password and IP Address have been specified, the connector executes the Connect App Request (via DWS). With a valid token, the next step is the GetElementInfo request.

The response is processed in order to fill in the **Elements Table**. The index of the Elements Table is used to compose a buffer to request the protocol info, which includes the protocol name, version and all its parameters.
**NOTE**: Not all protocols are processed because more than 1 element uses the same protocol name and version.

The tables **Dialog Protocols Overview** and **Unsupported Dialog Protocols Overview** are filled in after the buffer logic finishes.
