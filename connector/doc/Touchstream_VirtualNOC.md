### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTPS connection to communicate with the Touchstream API.

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: E.g. [https://tse.touchstream.global](https://tse.touchstream.global/)
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).

### Initialization

The connector requires an **API Key** (X-TS-ID header) and a **Bearer Key** (oauth Authorization header) in order to start the polling. These should be specified on the **General** page.
When this information has been added, the **Connection State** is "OK" if the device replies with "*HTTP/1.1 200 OK"* or "Error" for other HTTP responses.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.
