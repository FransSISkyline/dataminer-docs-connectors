# WISI Optopus

The **WISI Optopus** is an Optical Platform for FTTx and HFC. With this SNMP connector, you can control and monitor the parameters of the device.

## About

With the **WISI** **Optopus** platform, any module can be mounted into any slot, so that fully customized individual configuration is possible, specific to the intended application.

Every card inserted into one of the 14 slots will generate its own individual **Dynamic Virtual Element** (**DVE**) when this option is enabled. In the DVE, you can configure parameters and alarm monitoring related to that card (**Current Alarms**, **Alarm Log** and **Alarm configuration**).

Note that two SNMP connections are established with the device. **SnmpConnection2** has a different **Set community string** because some parameters require a different level of permissions, as stated in the MIB file.

From version 1.0.0.18 onwards, SSH communication with the device server can be done using RSA authentication. More details can be found in the documentation of new features of firmware version 2.1.0.0.

For more information about the device, please refer to the website <http://wisi.de/en/business/products/optopus/>.

## Configuration

### Connections

This connector uses two Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connections and requires the following input during element creation:

**SNMP Connection**:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
- **Device address**: Not used.

**SNMP Settings**:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private.*

**SnmpConnection2:**

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
- **Device address**: Not used.

**SNMP Settings**:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *Wisi.*

### Configuration of the SSH connection

When the element starts for the first time, all default values are set. In order to set passwordless communication between the element and the WISI device using RSA authentication, some steps must be taken. These only have to be done once.

A pair of keys must be provided to the WISI elements. By default they must be located under the folder *C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\WISI Optopus\SFTP.* To accomplish this, use the element's **Documents** folder in DataMiner Cube. Just add the keys using the **Add document** function. This will trigger the synchronization of the files throughout the cluster.

The key files should be created using **Putty Key Generator**. They must be of type *RSA,* using the *Open SSH* format and with *1040* bits (see "1" in the picture below). Save the public key from the panel by copying it to a file with the name provided in **RSA Public Key File Name.** Then export the private key to a file using the menu and save the file with the same name as **RSA Private Key File Name** (see "2" in the picture below). There is no need to set a **Key passphrase**.

Notes:

- The first time the element connects to the WISI Optopus SSH server, an entry is added to the *knownhosts.txt* file created under the same folder mentioned above. It works as a proof that the element trusts the device's server.
- Password authentication is only used while the connection is set up for the first time. After the new public key is uploaded and set, the **SSH Authentication Methods** parameter will be set to *Only Public Key Auth*. However, it is possible to revert to Key or Password authentication on the **Security** subpage of the **Network** page.
