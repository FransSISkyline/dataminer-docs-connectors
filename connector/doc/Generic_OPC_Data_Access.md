# Generic OPC Data Access

This is a virtual protocol that is used to subscribe to several items on a remote server and to monitor the received updates.

## About

This connector is used as an OPC DA (Data Access) client. You can specify the host address of one or more OPC servers. When the connection is established with a certain server, you can specify for which items you want to receive updates from the server. It is also possible to import or export the current subscription group.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

This connector uses a **virtual connection** and does not require any input during element creation.

### Configuration of OPC server and client

In order to enable OPC communication between a client and a remote server, create a user on the client and remote server with exactly the same name and password.

To set up DCOM correctly, make the following changes on the computer running the OPC server:

- Configuring the **application**:

  1. Launch the Component Services by typing "*dcomcnfg*" in the Start menu.
  1. Navigate to **Console Root \> Component Services \> Computers \> My Computer \> DCOM Config** and search for the OPC server. (This service might have a different name than "OPC Server"; a prefix of the vendor is likely to be added.) Then right-click **Properties**.
  1. In the **General** tab, verify that the **Authentication Level** is set to **Default**.
  1. In the **Location** tab, verify that the **Run Application on this computer** option is **enabled**.
  1. Open the **Security** tab.
  1. In **Launch and Activation Permissions**, select **Customize** and click **Edit**. This is necessary to grant permissions to users to start the OPC server. **Add** the same **user** (or **group**) as you created earlier. Use the **Check Names** button to check/select the correct user. Then make sure the Allow check boxes are checked for Local Launch, Remote Launch, Local Activation and Remote Activation:

     ![Launch and Activation Permissions.png](~/connector/images/Generic_OPC_Data_Access_Launch_and_Activation_Permissions.png)

  1. In **Access Permissions**, select **Customize** and click **Edit**. This is necessary to grant permission to users/groups to make calls to the OPC server. **Add** the same **user** (or **group**) as you created earlier. Use the **Check Names** button to check/select the correct user. Then make sure the Allow check boxes are checked for Local Access and Remote Access:

     ![Access Permission Permissions.png](~/connector/images/Generic_OPC_Data_Access_Access_Permission_Permissions.png)

- Configuring the **Application Identity**:

1. Launch the Component Services by typing "*dcomcnfg*" in the Start menu.

   1. Navigate to **Console Root \> Component Services \> Computers \> My Computer \> DCOM Config** and search for the OPC server. (This service might have a different name than "OPC Server"; a prefix of the vendor is likely to be added). Then right-click **Properties**.

   1. In the **Identity** tab, select **This user**. Then fill in the same **user** as you created earlier. Use the **Check Names** button to check/select the correct user.

      See the example below:

      ![Identity Example.png](~/connector/images/Generic_OPC_Data_Access_Identity_Example.png)

- Configuring the **System**:

  1. Launch the Component Services by typing "*dcomcnfg*" in the Start menu.
  1. Navigate to **Console Root \> Component Services \> Computers \> My Computer** and right-click **Properties**.
  1. In the **Default Properties** tab, select the option **Enable Distributed COM on this computer**:

     ![Default Properties.png](~/connector/images/Generic_OPC_Data_Access_Default_Properties.png)

  1. In the **COM Security** tab, select all the buttons one by one, each time adding the user you created earlier. Again you can use the **Check Names** button.
  1. In **Access Permissions**, make sure all options are enabled, as illustrated below, for the created user and for the **ANONYMOUS LOGON user**.

     ![Access Permission.png](~/connector/images/Generic_OPC_Data_Access_Access_Permission.png)

  1. In **Launch and Activation Permissions**, make sure all options are enabled, as illustrated below, for the created user and for the **ANONYMOUS LOGON user**.

     ![Launch and Activation Permission.png](~/connector/images/Generic_OPC_Data_Access_Launch_and_Activation_Permission.png)

Finally, you must validate the **firewall** on the client and server computer:

- Client side:

  - Create an **inbound** exception that allows computers using **TCP** on **all ports.**

    ![Client_OPCInbound.png](~/connector/images/Generic_OPC_Data_Access_Client_OPCInbound.png)

  - Create an **outbound** exception that allows computers using **TCP** on **port** **135.** Note that this port number could be different.

    ![Client_OPCOutbound.png](~/connector/images/Generic_OPC_Data_Access_Client_OPCOutbound.png)

- Server side:

  - Create **inbound** exceptions as illustrated below. This should normally be fine because **all ports** are allowed.

    ![Server_OPCInbounds.png](~/connector/images/Generic_OPC_Data_Access_Server_OPCInbounds.png)

  - Create an **outbound** exception that allows computers using **TCP** on **port** **135.** Note that this port number could be different.
