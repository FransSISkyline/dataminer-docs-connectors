# Measat VSAT Broadband Management

This a custom connector for Measat that retrieves data from an NMS and makes it available to be ingested by Measat's low-code app and dashboard. Custom parameters in the connector include the overall site count of the networks in East and West Malaysia and the congestion status of the group QOS.

At present, the following NMS is supported: iDirect.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### MySQL Connection

This connector connects to a MySQL database and an archive database where data from the NMS is stored.

### Initialization

To set up the MySQL connection to the *nms* server with the config data, configure the following parameters on the General page of the element:

- **Database Config Server**: The IP address of the MySQL server.
- **Database Config User Name**: The user name of the account to log in to the MySQL server.
- **Database Config Password**: The password of the account to log in to the MySQL server.
- **Database Config Name**: The name of the database being accessed on the MySQL server.

To set up the MySQL connection to the *nrd_archive* server with the site count data, configure the following parameters on the General page of the element:

- **Database Site Count Server**: The IP address of the MySQL archive server with the *state_change_log* database table.
- **Database Congestion Server**: The IP address of the MySQL archive server with the *nms_group_qos_stats* database table.
- **Database Archive User Name**: The user name of the account to log in to the MySQL archive server.
- **Database Archive Password**: The password of the account to log in to the MySQL archive server.
- **Database Archive Name**: The name of the database being accessed on the MySQL archive server.

## How to use

On the **General** page of this connector, you can configure the connection with the config and archive databases. This page also shows when the most recent data was polled.

On the **Site Counts** page, you can view the networks in the West Malaysia and East Malaysia tables and the online and offline sites for each network. The overall site count is also present here for both the West Malaysia and East Malaysia gateways.

On the **Site Count Configuration** subpage, you can set the allowable sites for all of the networks in either West or East Malaysia at once and also set the alarm threshold for the status of the networks.

On the **Network Congestion** page, you can view the network congestion status and the inroute group congestion status for both West and East Malaysia. The congestion is based on the upstream inroute group current slot usage and downstream network percentage of free bandwidth remaining.

On the **Traffic and Capacity** page, you can view the network traffic and capacity status for both West and East Malaysia. The traffic and capacity is based on the upstream and downstream throughput and also has the average and 95th percentile of the data for the past 24 hours.

On the **Monthly Calculations** subpage, the **Get 30 Days 95TH Percentile** button will run the calculations for the previous month. A Scheduler app will run to execute this on the first day of every month to collect the data to present in the low-code app.

On the **Group QOS Congestion** page, you can view the Group QOS congestion status for both West and East Malaysia. The Group QOS congestion is based on the free bandwidth against the allocated bandwidth for each group QOS.

On the **Congestion Configuration** subpage, you can set the threshold for when a group QOS would be considered congested.

On the **Resources** subpage, you can view the polled Net Modem, Network, Group QOS, and Beams data.

### Notes

This connector is part of the VSAT Broadband Manager package, which also comes with low-code apps, dashboards, and Automation scripts.
