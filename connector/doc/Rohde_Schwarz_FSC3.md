## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

This connector requires that the VISA library is installed on the DataMiner Agent. The installer for the library can be downloaded from the [Rohde-Schwarz website](https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/driver-pages/remote-control/3-visa-and-tools_231388.html).

In addition, the *RsInstrument.dll* must also be present in the *C:\Skyline DataMiner\ProtocolScripts\DllImport* folder of the DataMiner Agent. If you deploy the connector from the Catalog to a cloud-connected DataMiner System, this DLL will be automatically stored there. If you install the connector via a .dmprotocol package, the DLL will also be included and added in the correct location.

## How to Use

On the **General** page, the **IP Address** parameter must be filled in order for the polling to start. That page also displays generic information like the **Serial Number** and the **Firmware**.

The spectrum can be observed on the **Spectrum** **Analyzer** page.
