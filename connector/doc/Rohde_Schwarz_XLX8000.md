# Rohde Schwarz XLX8000

This connector has been developed for devices such as the **Rohde Schwarz XLX8000**. It polls several SNMP parameters and displays them on different pages. It also allows the user to configure certain settings. Traps are intercepted for status information.

## About

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *broadcast*.
