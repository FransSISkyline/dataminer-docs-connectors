## How to Use

### Version with Serial Connections

#### Matrix

This page gives an overview of the current matrix configuration. The number of inputs and outputs can be configured in the **Number of Inputs** and **Number of Outputs** parameters, respectively.

The Output Table gives an overview of which input is connected to which output.

#### MON Overview

The **Set MON Name** parameter can be used to add an entry to the **MON Overview** table. Once an entry has been added to the **MON Overview** table, the **Output Table** will be polled.

#### Advanced

This page allows you to set advanced switching using the **Advanced Switching** parameter.

#### Matrix Status

On this page, you can find an overview of the crosspoints (**Crosspoints**), the crosspoints buffer (**Crosspoints Buffer**), and status information (**Status Information** and **Communication Status**).

### Version with SNMP Connection

### General

This page shows the general information of the device. It displays its status and name.

### Matrices

This page displays the Matrices Table.

### Levels

This page displays the Levels Table. The format of the index is {Matrices Index}.{Levels ID}.

### Sources

This page displays the Sources Table. The format of the index is {Levels Index}.{Sources ID}.

The display name can be configured in the format **Source Index**.**Choice**. This choice can be either the alternative name, a 4-character name, an 8-character name, a 12-character name, or a 16-character name.

The **Audio Modify** parameter specifies the type of audio modification performed on the sources, such as *Audio Normal* or *Audio Swap*. This can be configured in the table.

The respective enabled and lock state, which are used in the matrix, can also be configured in the table.

#### Source Association

This page displays the Source Association Table and the Source Association Sources.

#### Source Settings

In the Sources Table, there is a display name column to identify each row. The format of this display name is "**Source Index**.**Choice**". This choice can be either the alternative name, a 4-character name, an 8-character name, a 12-character name, or a 16-character name. The default configuration uses the 16-character name.

### Destinations

This page displays the Destinations Table. The format of the index is {Levels Index}.{Destinations Id}.

The display name can be configured in the format **Destination Index**.**Choice**. This choice can be either the alternative name, a 4-character name, an 8-character name, a 12-character name, or a 16-character name.

The routed source can also be configured in the table, as well as the respective enabled and lock state, which are used in the matrix.

#### Destination Settings
