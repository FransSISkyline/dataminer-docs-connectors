## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses a HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
- **Device address**: The device address (default: *ByPassProxy*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

On the **General** page, you can find the **Polling Status: Tree Structure** and **Polling Status: Values**.

The **Tree Control** page contains a tree overview with all the nodes received from the device. When the parent node of a metric is selected, its values are displayed in the extra tab **Values**.
