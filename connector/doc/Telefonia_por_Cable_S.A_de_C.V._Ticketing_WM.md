## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection - Main

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to use

This connector will retrieve information from the **SNR Upstream Aggregation, DS Service Group Aggregation, and US Service Group Aggregation** and will build tickets if the aggregation has one or more critical incidents in the last 24 hours.

When the entries for the tickets have been created, it will start processing every ticket, and it will retrieve the information necessary to create the ticket JSON that is required by the customer API to generate tickets on the ticketing platforms.

After all tickets have been processed, they are split and sent to all available Telefonia por Cable S.A de C.V. Ticketing BE elements for further processing.

As this is a virtual connector, **no data traffic** will be shown in **Stream Viewer**.
