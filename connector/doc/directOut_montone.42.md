## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

From version 1.1.0.4 onwards, there is a mechanism in this connector that will detect when the element is in timeout and automatically switch over to the other IP address. The connector will use the parameters for **Port 1 IP** and **Port 2 IP** to decide which IP to switch to, based on the actively polled IP address.

On the **Network** subpage, the **Actively Polled IP** parameter will show the IP address that is currently being polled by DataMiner.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element created with this connector consists of the following data pages:

- **General:** Contains general information about the device.

- As of range 1.1.0.x, there is a configurable parameter to switch between the MONTONE.42 module and the RAV.IO module.

- **Advanced:** Contains PTP and advanced network settings.

- **Input Streams:** Contains input stream configuration data and ports data (for port 1 and 2).

- **Output Streams:** Contains output stream configuration data and ports data (for port 1 and 2).

- **PTP Config:** Contains PTP clock configuration parameters (accuracy, delays, timeouts and basic settings).

- **PTP Status:** Contains PTP clock status parameters (accuracy, offset and priorities).

- **Network Advanced Settings:** Contains the user-configurable network parameters (ports and announcements).

- **Web Interface:** Contains the web interface of the device.
