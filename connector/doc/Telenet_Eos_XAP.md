## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *xxx.yyy.zzz.com*.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the device, e.g. *8080*.
- **Device address**: The device address (default: *ByPassProxy*).

## How to Use

The element consists of the data pages detailed below.

### General

The **General** page includes the following parameters:

- **Press Key**: This parameter is used to simulate the pressing of buttons on the remote control. You can select a specific key to trigger an action on the set-top box. It supports discrete measurements, providing a clear response for each action.
- **HDMI Resolution**: Displays or configures the current HDMI output resolution of the set-top box. You can use this to read the current resolution and set a new resolution to adjust the display settings as required.

### Settings

The **Settings** page includes the following parameters:

- **Set-Top Box ID**: A unique identifier for the EOS XAP set-top box. This parameter is essential for differentiating between devices in a multi-device environment.
- **Video Stream URL**: Specifies the URL for the video stream associated with the set-top box. This parameter is critical for defining the source or destination of the video stream and supports both reading and writing operations.
