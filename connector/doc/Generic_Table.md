## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### General

This page will show a table containing all the ingested data from a CSV or XLSX file. After the required files have been imported, you can change any of the imported values.

### Import Table Configuration

On this page, you can specify the folder where the CSV and XLSX files are stored and can select which file you want to import.

In the **File to Import** drop-down box, only CSV and XLSX files will be displayed, if any are available in the specified folder.

If new files have been added into the folder and they do not show up in the File to Import drop-down box, click the **Refresh List** button.
