# Lawo V_pro8

This connector can be used to monitor and control Lawo V_pro8 devices. Lawo describes this device as the complete 8 channel video processing toolkit.

## About

All information is polled from the device over SNMP in connector range 1.x, or the smart-serial (Ember+) protocol in connector range 2.x.

The Ember+ version of the connector is much more extensive than the SNMP version. For example, it also contains matrix controls, that allows the operator to see and change crosspoints between inputs and outputs.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or hostname of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device. This is required.

### Configuration

No additional configuration is necessary after creating the element.

## Usage

### General

Displays general information of the device: product code, serial number, software version, role, etc.

There is also a button that allows an operator to reboot the device.

### Status

Contains parameters that hold the status of the most important components of the system: **inputs, outputs, power supplies, fan, temperature**.

### Inputs
