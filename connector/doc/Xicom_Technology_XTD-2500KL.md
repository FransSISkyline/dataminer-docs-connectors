# Xicom Technology XTD-2500KL

The XTD-2500KL is a compact antenna-mounted high-power amplifier designed for applications requiring high transmit power levels.

## About

The Xicom Technology XTD-2500KL connector is based on the connector XTD-400K from the same vendor. The main difference between these connectors is that the Xicom Technology XTD-2500KL connector uses a single command to retrieve and display the Helix voltage and current for both amplifier tubes. It was also modified to have cleaner code and updated code for readability and usability.
