# EMC Isilon x200

The **EMC Isilon x200**, powered by the OneFS operating system, uses a versatile but simple scale-out storage architecture to allow rapid access to massive amounts of data, while reducing cost and complexity.

This connector was designed to make the current statistics provided by the device available in an element.

## About

This connector makes use of **HTTP** commands to retrieve information about the current statistics. The information is retrieved using the Isilon **OneFS API Reference**.

Data is polled at 15-second intervals. The **Session Cookie** will be renewed automatically after the **Session Timeout Absolute** has expired.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### HTTP main connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination. By default, *8080*.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy*.

#### HTTP secondary connection

In branch 2.0.0.x, this connector uses a secondary HTTP connection, which requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination. By default, *8080*.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy*.

### Configuration of credentials

In order to start a new cookie session between DataMiner and the OneFS system, you must set the **OneFS User Name** and **Password** on the **General** page.

**Note:** If you need a **CSRF Authentication Cookie**, please **enable this option**, otherwise you will **not be able to poll information** from the device.

## Usage

### General

On this page, the **OneFS User Name**/**Password** must be set.

Below this, information is displayed about the currently established session. In branch 2.0.0.x, there is not only information on the currently established session, but also on the connectivity of the two HTTP connections.

With the buttons on the right-hand side of the page, you can enable or disable polling of a certain group of keys. In branch 2.0.0.x, these **polling** controls are on the left.

### Cluster

### Web Interface

This page displays the web interface of the device. Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.

## Notes

In order to properly parse the information coming from the device, you need to have .Net Framework 4.5 installed.
