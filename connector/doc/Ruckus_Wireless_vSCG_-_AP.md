# Ruckus Wireless vSCG - AP

The **Ruckus Wireless Virtualized SmartCell Gateway** (vSCG) is an NFV-based and cloud-ready WLAN controller for service providers and enterprises that require a high flexibility and resiliency in their WLAN deployment. This is an **SNMP- and HTTP**-based protocol for the Ruckus Wireless vSCG.

## About

This connector was designed to monitor and receive numerous statistics for the vSCG, the access points (APs) connected to it and the client stations (STAs) connected to these APs. In other words, the entire WLAN controlled by the vSCG can be monitored using this protocol.

This connector is generated automatically by the connector **Ruckus Wireless vSCG**.
