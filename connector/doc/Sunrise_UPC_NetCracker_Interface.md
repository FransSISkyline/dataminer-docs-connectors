# Sunrise UPC NetCracker Interface

The Netcracker element is a DataMiner element that will be used as an interface with the JMS (JavaMessage Service).

## About

The communication between Netcracker and DataMiner will be done through the Java Message Service (JMS). This technology allows Netcracker to communicate to DataMiner asynchronously using JMS queries. Based on Netcracker documentation, two queues are used (hosted by Netcracker platform):

- JMS to DataMiner: Requests from Netcracker to DataMiner
- DataMiner to JMS: Responses from DataMiner to Netcracker
