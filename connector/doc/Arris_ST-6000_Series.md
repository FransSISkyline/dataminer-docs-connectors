# Arris ST-6000 Series

This is a DataMiner connector for the **Arris ST-6000 Series**, an advanced multi-channel, multi-format video transcoder.

## About

The **Arris ST-6000 Series** connector is used to catch a failover trap and instruct the device during this procedure.

## Installation and configuration

The connector has two interfaces. The **SNMP interface** is used for SNMP traps and to monitor the device, and the **HTTP interface** is used for communication with the device during failover.

#### Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private.*

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*

HTTP Settings:

- **Bus address**: This field can be used to bypass the proxy. To do so, fill in the value *bypassproxy*.

## Usage (1.0.0.x - 2.0.0.x)

The element should be part of a redundancy group that takes care of the failover.

### Configurations

Each operation has a **status parameter**, showing *Ok*, *Busy* or *Failed*. Below this, the **timestamp** shows the last time an operation was attempted and resulted in *Ok* or *Failed*. The operations can be started with the following buttons:

- **Save Configuration**: Request the device to store the current configuration.
- **Download Configuration File**: Download the created configuration file.
- **Disable Multicast Ports**: Disable active multicast ports and store which ones were active.
- **Re-enable UDP Ports**: Enable the previously active multicast ports.
- **Upload Configuration File**: Upload the local configuration file to the device.
- **Select Configuration File**: Load the configuration file as the active configuration.
- **Restart All Channels**: Restart all the channels to complete the configuration switch and set the device as active.

### General

This page displays general information about the device.

### Output UDP

On this page, the **Output UDP Table** shows information about each output and allows you to disable or enable each one. When one or more outputs are enabled, the **UDP Ports** status will change from *Disabled* to *Enabled*.

### Alarms

On this page, the **Status Current Alarm Table** lists all the active alarms of the device.

### Traps

On this page, you can edit the trap destination and settings in the **Trap Receivers Table**. The received traps can be viewed and cleared in the **Trap Status Table**.
