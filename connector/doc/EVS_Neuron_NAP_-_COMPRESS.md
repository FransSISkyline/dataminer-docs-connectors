## Configuration

### Connections

#### Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (fixed value: 2072).

## How to Use

The connector does not have a polling timer. It only polls the data at element startup; however, there is also a button available that allows you to trigger the polling manually.

After element startup, the connector can also receive events (unsolicited messages).
