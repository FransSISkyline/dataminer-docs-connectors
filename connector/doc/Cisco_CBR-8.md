# Cisco CBR-8

The Cisco CBR-8 is a next-generation Evolved Converged Cable Access Platform (CCAP) that delivers multigigabit and Internet-of-Everything services at a lower TOC to cable operators.

## About

This connector provides a general overview of the Cisco CBR-8 device and mainly displays the upstream details. It uses the SNMPv2 protocol to communicate with the device.

The connector uses regular timers that trigger every 60 and 120 seconds, as well as a timer that triggers every 30 minutes to perform data cleaning.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP main connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.

- **Get community string**: The community string needed to read from the device.

- **Set community string**: The community string needed to set to the device.

## Usage (Range 1.0.x.x)

### General

This page displays the system information, main rate usage or memory and CPU usage, a summary of cable modem information, and rate information on upstream and downstream channel utilization, transmission, and capacity.

The page contains a number of page buttons:
