# Imagine Communications ACO6800+ASID

The ACO6800+ switchover module is designed for the 6800+T core processing platform and provides both the primary and backup paths critical to maintaining uninterrupted video and audio signal flow.

## About

The ACO6800+ is available as a single- or dual-channel module that provides switchover capabilities from the primary to the backup path in the event of a signal failure. In addition to the basic switchover module, the ACO6800+ is also available as an intelligent Q-SEET-compliant module that monitors video, audio and metadata at ingest, checks levels for consistency and scans for errors.

ACO6800+ASID switches the signal between redundant signals at the point of ingest into a satellite DTH, mobile TV, or IPTV facility as well as switches the signal on redundant paths within a facility.
