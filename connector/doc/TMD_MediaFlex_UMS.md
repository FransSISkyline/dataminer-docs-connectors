# TMD MediaFlex UMS

The TMD MediaFlex UMS connector integrates the Mediaflex Unified Media Services Cloud platform into DataMiner. This platform pushes the list of scheduled events to the DataMiner connector, which in turn will display the events in a table and trigger an Automation script, automatically or manually, to create the corresponding SRM bookings.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

### Initialization

#### 1.0.0.x

On the **Configuration** page, fill in **sites** that the bookings support in the Sites table.

#### 2.0.0.x

On the **Configuration** page, configure the web service hosted by the element. This web service is used to receive notifications coming from MediaFlex.

## How to use

### 1.0.0.x

Bookings and all their relevant information are located on the **General** page. The connector adds entries by parsing an **HTTP** response.

You can find additional settings for the Bookings table on the **Configuration** page. Site names should be configured before any bookings are created.

### 2.0.0.x

Notifications coming from MediaFlex and sent to the web service hosted by the element are placed in the **File Status Updates** table on the **General** page.

With the linked **ConnectorAPI NuGet package**, you can send metadata workflow updates to MediaFlex.
