# CEFD CDM Qx SNMP

This protocol is used to control and monitor the CEFD CDM Qx SNMP device

## About

This connector uses an **SNMP** connection and a **serial** connection to communicate with the device.

The snmp connection will poll the device to retrieve the information and also allows sets to control the device.

A serial connection is used to get and set the LSR state.

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device. (default: public)
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device. (default: private)

#### Serial SerialPort Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Direct connection:
  - **Baudrate**: Baudrate specified in the manual of the device.
  - **Databits**: Databits specified in the manual of the device.
  - **Stopbits**: Stopbits specified in the manual of the device.
  - **Parity**: Parity specified in the manual of the device.
  - **FlowControl**: FlowControl specified in the manual of the device.
- Interface connection:
  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.
