# CEFD ViperSat

The **ViperSat Management System (VMS)** is a server- and client-based network management system that gathers and processes information it receives from the modem/routers that comprise a ViperSat satellite network.
The modem's internal microprocessor-based input/output (I/O) controller measures, captures and transmits real-time network operating parameters to the VMS via either **PLDM (Path Loss Data Message)** or **SUM (Status Update Message)** packets, depending on the type of modem/router.

This connector will export different connectors based on the retrieved data (see "System Info" below).

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection - Main

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

- **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *5150*.

- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy*.

## How to Use

The **REST**ful interface is used to retrieve and configure the device information via different HTTP methods:

- HTTP GET: Return the current state of a VMS element.

- HTTP PUT: Update the state of a VMS element.

- HTTP POST: Create a new instance of a VMS element.

- HTTP DELETE: Delete a VMS element.

For example, to **retrieve a list of satellites**, an HTTP GET would be issued to <http://vms-server:5150/rf/satellites>. This would return an XML document containing the URLs of each satellite.

A query string appended to the URL, i.e. subset=\*, could be used to request additional details per satellite, or filter the results.

An **HTTP GET request** to the URL <http://vms-server:5150/rf/satellite/1> would return an **XML** document containing the details of the satellite with identifier of 1.

To **modify the satellite**, the document needs to be updated and then sent back to the server via an HTTP PUT request.

To **create a new satellite**, an appropriately formatted document must be created and then posted to the URL <http://vms-server:5150/rf/satellites>. This would construct the new satellite and return the URL to a specific location.
