## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

### Initialization

On the **Credentials** page, specify the necessary credentials in the **Username** and **Password** parameters. Also make sure the **Server Name**, **Vhost Name**, and **Instance Name** are correctly filled in, so that the API requests will be able to function correctly. By default, these parameters are populated with the default values obtained from the device documentation.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

The connector requests the list of server applications that are going to be monitored by the element.

In the **Applications** table, you can configure which of the applications should be monitored.

Once an application is enabled, the element will request the information for that application. That information will be displayed in the **Monitored Applications** table, **Connection Count Table** and **Monitoring Historic** table. In case the application is disabled, its information will be removed from the tables.

Note: All applications are enabled for monitoring by default.

In the **Configure Metrics** table, you can customize the name of the metrics in order to have more readable keys. This change is then reflected in the metric name in the **Monitoring Historic** table (in the Metric column).

Note: By default, the name of the metric in the **Monitoring Historic** and **Configure Metrics Table** is the position number of the list that comes from each entry.
