# Slack Messaging

This connector can be used to integrate Skyline DataMiner with a **Slack workspace**. It will communicate with Slack and ensure that the configured list of actions is executed. In order to keep this connector as general as possible, these actions are defined in **Automation scripts**.

When commands are sent into a Slack channel, these will be picked up by the element running this connector. When the element detects a known command, it will execute the Automation script linked to that command.

> [!TIP]
> To find out more about how this connector can be used to unify your team's communication between DataMiner and Slack, check out the [Slack Messaging use case](https://community.dataminer.services/use-case/slack-messaging/) on DataMiner Dojo.

## About

**HTTP communication** is used to communicate with the Slack API ([http://api.slack.com](http://api.slack.com/)). Two separate connections are made: one connection to the WEB API, and a second (web socket) connection to the RTM API.

The connector periodically retrieves the list of users and conversations via the WEB API (using polling), while messages that users send in a channel are pushed to the connector via the web socket interface.

**Access tokens** are used to authenticate on the API. Such a token can be obtained from the app configuration webpage. For more information, refer to the "Installation and configuration" section below.

Automation scripts that can be executed via Slack must have the following **specific dummies and parameters**, as otherwise they will be ignored:

- Dummy "SLACK": The Slack DataMiner element that is executing the script.
- Parameter "CONVUSERNAME": The other end user name. This can be used by the script to reply with messages referring to the name of the Slack user that invoked a command.
- Parameter "CONVID": The ID of the Slack conversation in which the command was invoked.
- Parameter "SLACKARGUMENTS": The plain text after the command name that was provided by the Slack user when the command was invoked.

Users can use the "!list" command to retrieve an overview of all compatible and enabled scripts that can be executed. The command for each script can be customized on the "Automation Scripts" page.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### HTTP WEB API connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination. Must be slack.com.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination, by default 443.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.*

#### HTTP RTM API connection

This connector uses an HTTP (web socket) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination. Must be slack.com.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination. Default: 443
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.*

### Configuration of the Slack application and bot user

This integration works based on a Slack bot that must be preconfigured via the Slack API website. Follow the following steps in order to do this configuration:

1. Go to <https://api.slack.com/apps>.
2. Click "Create New App".
3. Provide a name for the app (i.e. DataMiner), and select the workspace in which you want to integrate the app.
4. Click "Create App".
5. Go to the "Bot Users" page and select "Add Bot User".
6. Give the bot user a name (i.e. DataMiner), and make sure that "Always Show My Bot as Online" option is turned off. The bot user will automatically be online when the connector is connected to the web socket connection.
7. Click "Add Bot User".
8. Install the application in your workspace, in order to receive the bot authentication token that can be used in the element.
9. Copy the "Bot User Oauth Access Token", and paste it in the "OAuth Access Token" parameter on the Authentication page of the Slack element in DataMiner.

   The connector will now connect to the Slack API, and shortly afterwards the bot user will come online.

## Usage

### General

This page displays general information on the Slack team to which the element is currently connected.

### Users

This page contains a table with all users that are part of the Slack team.

![Users.jpg](~/connector/images/Slack_Messaging_Users.jpg)

### Conversations

This page contains a table listing all possible conversations (public channels, private channels, instant messaging) that messages can be sent to. The "Send Message" column allows you to quickly send a message to a specific conversation. The last received message is shown in the "Last Message" column.

### Automation Scripts

This page contains a table with all existing Automation scripts in DataMiner that can be executed via commands in Slack.

![Scripts.jpg](~/connector/images/Slack_Messaging_Scripts.jpg)

To refresh the content of this table, use the **Refresh** button.

The **Description** column contains user-defined text that is presented when the list command is requested from a conversation.

A **Command** can be assigned to each Automation script. When a user sends one of these commands in one of the channels that include the bot, the connector will run the linked Automation script. This allows the administrator to freely configure the name of the commands associated with each Automation script.

The **State** column allows you to enable or disable the possibility to execute a particular script.

Only scripts that were adapted to be compatible with this Slack integration are shown in the table. In order for a script to be valid, it must have the following dummy and parameters:

- Dummy "SLACK": The Slack DataMiner element that is executing the script.
- Parameter "CONVUSERNAME": The other end user name. This can be used by the script to reply with messages referring to the name of the Slack user that invoked a command.
- Parameter "CONVID": The ID of the Slack conversation in which the command was invoked.
- Parameter "SLACKARGUMENTS": The plain text after the command name that was provided by the Slack user when the command was invoked.

### Tracked Messages

Added in version 1.0.0.3.

This page contains a table with all tracked messages. These messages are linked with a unique tag (identifier), which can be used to update the message inside the Slack channel.

The number of days that messages should remain in the table can be customized.

### Authentication

On this page, the **OAuth access token** that should be used to communicate with the Slack API must be configured. The page also contains some parameters that display the current status of the authentication.

### Websocket

This page displays information about the web socket connection towards the Slack RTM API.

### Web Interface

This page displays the app configuration page on the Slack API website. Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.

## Notes

### External sets

The connector provides the functionality to send a message from an external source in DataMiner (i.e. an Automation script) to a channel in Slack. This can be done in two different ways:

- Simple XML:

- Set to parameter with **ID 50**
  - Only basic formatting
  - Format is XML: \<Message\>\<Channel\>name or ID of the channel \</Channel\>\<Text\>the text to send to the channel\</Text\>\<Tag\>unique identifier\</Tag\>\</Message\>
  - Tag can be chosen by the sender to be able to uniquely identify the message. This can be used later to send an update of this message to the Slack channel.

- Raw JSON string:

- Set to parameter with **ID 51**
  - Allows more advanced formatting and attachments
  - Format: see <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage>
  - JSON is sent directly to the chat.postMessage WEB API method, without modifications

From version 1.0.0.3 onwards, it is also possible to update a message that was previously sent to a Slack channel with a unique tag assigned:

- Set to parameter with **ID 52**
- Format is XML: \<Message\>\<Tag\>unique identifier of the message\</Tag\>\<Text\>new message\</Text\>\<Message\>
