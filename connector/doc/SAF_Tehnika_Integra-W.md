## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMPv2 main connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) v2 connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMPv2 settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private*.

#### SNMPv3 main connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) v3 connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMPv3 Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Security Level and Protocol:** The security level used by the protocol, by default *authPriv*.
- **User Name**: The user name used to connect to the device. Make sure this user has **write access**, as otherwise no sets will be possible.
- **Authentication password**: The password of the given user.
- **Encryption password**: The encryption password used for the given user.
- **Authentication algorithm**: The type of algorithm used during authentication, by default *HMAC-SHA*.
- **Encryption algorithm**: The type of algorithm used for encryption, by default *AES128*.

#### Serial IP Connection

This connector also uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element consists of the data pages detailed below.

### General

This page displays information about the system and host, such as **System Description**, **System Up Time**, **System Name**, **Host System Uptime**, etc.

For the 1.0.1.x range, the **SSH** credentials need to be set on this page for the modem bandwidth and modulation sets and the loop back tests to work.

The **System Reboot** button on this page allows you to restart the system.

### Integra-W Pages

This section contains the following pages:

- **System**: This page displays information about the system, such as **CPU Temperature**, **PSU Voltage**, etc.

- **Ethernet**: This page contains the **Interface Status Table** and the **Interface Statistics Table**.
- **Configuration**: This page allows you to **execute** or **store** a new **configuration** and contains the **Net CFG IP** parameters.
- **Alarm**: This page displays the last time an alarm was changed and contains the **Alarm Table**.
- **Loop Back Test**: This page contains the buttons for the **Modem Loop Back** and **RF Loop Back** self tests. Before you run the loop back self tests, you need to fill in the corresponding **Time** parameters.

### Management Pages

This section contains the following pages:

- **Interfaces**: Displays the Number of Interfaces, Interface Table and Interface X Table.
- **IP Status**: This page contains the **IP Address Table**, **IP Address Prefix** and **Address Translation Table**. The page also contains page buttons that provide access to the **IP Route Tables**, **IP Net Tables** and **IP System Tables**.
