# CISCO D9800

The Cisco D9800 Network Transport Receiver supports high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) and ultra-high-definition (UHD) delivery over satellite and IP terrestrial content distribution networks requiring DVB-S (Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite), DVB-S2 (Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite - Second Generation), and IP reception capabilities. This device can decode an MPEG-2, advanced video coding (AVC), or HEVC video-encoded service, and it can output the serial digital interface (SDI) or composite uncompressed video.

The Cisco D9800 connector polls values in order to display information about the device and allows you to configure certain parameters.

The connector retrieves and sets information on the device through HTTP and SNMP.
