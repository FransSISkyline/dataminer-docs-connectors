# Snell Wilcox LC4000

This protocol implements the proprietary RollCall protocol for the LC4000 device (sometimes also referred to as the Snell Wilcox KUDOSIQP).

A smart-serial single protocol is used, so that connections from different elements are not combined in one connection to the device. When a client connects to the server, it is assigned a unique port that will identify it on the RollCall network.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Smart Serial Single RollCall connection

This connector uses a smart-serial single connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: Required. Default: *2050*.
  - **Bus address**: Required. Uses the format UU:PP, where UU is the unit address of the IP server on RollNet network (e.g. 06), and PP is the unique port address assigned by the server (e.g. 01).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.
