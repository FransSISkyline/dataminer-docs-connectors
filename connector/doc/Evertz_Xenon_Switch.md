# Evertz Xenon Switch

The **Evertz Xenon Switch** offers both the flexibility of multiformat operation and the ability to add signal processing technology. To avoid single points of failure, active assemblies are hot-swappable from the front of the frame, and power, control, cooling and reference generation are available in redundant configurations.

## About

The **Evertz Xenon Switch** connector uses both SNMP and serial communication to monitor the Evertz switch. The device contains two controllers, but only one can be in control at a time. The controller in control will be interrogated using SNMP queries and Ethernet queries.

To avoid issues because of excessive polling, the device is polled at startup and whenever a message of type .UVxxx,xxx is received. In addition, in case the device is configured using a different tool so that such messages are not received, it is also polled daily.

Between requests, there is a pause of 0.5 seconds. This prevents the loop from going too fast and keeps the device from going into error state. Note, however, that this does mean that it will take a while for the element to load the entire matrix (since version 1.0.0.7).

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private*.

#### Serial SerialPort Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION (**TCP/IP**):

- Direct connection:

  - **Baudrate**: Baudrate specified in the manual of the device.
  - **Databits**: Databits specified in the manual of the device.
  - **Stopbits**: Stopbits specified in the manual of the device.
  - **Parity**: Parity specified in the manual of the device.
  - **FlowControl**: FlowControl specified in the manual of the device.

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device (port *23*).
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device (range: *16 - 1*). The bus address is used as the **Matrix Level**:

    | Bus Address number | Matrix Level |
    |--------------------|--------------|
    | 1                  | V            |
    | 2                  | A            |
