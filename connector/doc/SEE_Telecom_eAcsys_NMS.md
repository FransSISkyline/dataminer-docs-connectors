# SEE Telecom eAcsys NMS

The **SEE Telecom eAcsys NMS** is a management system that manages other elements that are used for Optical/RF transmission/reception. Other than that, it also monitors the state of the network element's chassis and the status of its PSU.

This connector monitors and controls an **SEE Telecom eAcsys NMS** management system, allowing the end user to assess Optical/RF measurements performed by the device, and to perform actions on the devices controlled by the device*.*

## About

This connector uses SNMP and polls the following information every five minutes:

- Device uptime
- Transmission/reception statistics
- PSU and chassis information
- EEPROM information

In addition, the connector polls generic information every 24 hours.

Finally, this connector will export different connectors based on the retrieved data. A list can be found in the section *"*Exported Connectors" below*.*

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **Device address**: The device address, ranged between *1* and *16*.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device. The default value is *private*.
