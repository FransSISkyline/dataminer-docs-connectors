## Configuration

### Creation

#### SNMP Connection â€“ Main

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

## Usage

The element created with this connector mainly contains pages where the **system**, **modules**, **sensors**, and **interfaces** are monitored. You can activate alarm monitoring on any parameter to be kept aware of its status.
