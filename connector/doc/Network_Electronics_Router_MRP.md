# Network Electronics Router MRP

The Network Electronics MRP matrix routers can be controlled and monitored using this connector.

## About

Range 2.1.0.x uses serial communication and introduces virtual matrixes. It works with MRP rev3.0, syntax v3. The connector allows you to manage connections of logical routers (i.e. levels) that are partitions of the physical device. Virtual routers allow you to manage connections on multiple levels at the same time.

The Network Electronics MRP matrix routers are polled with SNMP from version 3.0.0.x onwards, and can connect each output with a single input. In addition, they allow the user to monitor fans, voltages, temperatures, etc.

Version 1.0.2.1:

- Matrix size has been increased to 1024x1024.

Version 3.0.0.7 and higher:

- The crosspoints are now retrieved and set using MRP communication. This happens on port *4381* and has been implemented to provide higher performance when the matrix is edited. All other values use SNMP.

Version 3.0.0.8 and higher:

- The maximum matrix size has been increased to 264x264.
- For backwards compatibility, the *port.xml* file will be imported after the first startup of the element, and stored as *port_v3.xml* from then onwards.
- Note that there might be compatibility issues for the 1.x.x.x range due to some shifts in parameter IDs. The matrix write parameter currently has parameter ID 1060; labels were moved to 4000 and 5000.
- Please also read the additional configuration section regarding SNMP- and MRP-compatible controllers.

## Configuration

### Connections - Range 1.0.0.x, 1.0.1.x, and 1.0.2.x

#### Serial Connection - Main

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *4381*.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device, by default *1*.

### Connections - Range 2.1.0.x

#### Serial Connection - Main

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *4381*.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device, by default *1*.

#### Serial Connection - StatusMessages

This connector uses a smart serial connection to retrieve spontaneous status messages and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default ** *4381*.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device, by default *1*.

### Connections - Range 3.0.0.x

#### SNMP Connection - Main

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
- **Device address**: Determines the level of the router that will be retrieved.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private.*

### Configuration (range 3.0.0.x)

By default, the **Request Matrix Data** parameter is set to *Sublime* (see "Settings" section below). This will prevent any SNMP polling, technically supporting controllers with only MRP. Enabling *Compact* or *Modular* could irreversibly cause the element to go into timeout if SNMP is not supported by the controller.

## Usage (ranges other than 3.0.0.x)

### Main View

This page contains the matrix to configure the **Logical Router**. Each output needs at most one input connection. Each input can be connected to up to the maximum number of outputs. Larger matrices have their inputs and outputs grouped by 16. Clicking a group will open or close it. The **labels** correspond to the retrieved aliases for each of the items (inputs or outputs). **Locks** are effective only on outputs.

### Logical Router Status

This page contains information related to the Logical Router displayed on the Main View page. **Size**, **Format** and **Description** give an overview of the level and are displayed as parameters. **Inputs** and **Outputs** with corresponding **Names**, **Aliases**, **Descriptions**, **Labels**, **Crosspoints** and **Locks** are listed in tables.

### Virtual Router View

This page displays the matrix to configure the **Virtual Router.** A drop-down menu allows you to select a **Virtual Router** from a list. **Size** and **Description** are displayed as parameters. Disconnecting crosspoints of the virtual matrix is not allowed, only switching.

Within a text box, a **Log** is displayed with the last changes to the connections of the virtual router. This box will contain warnings in case connections are out of bounds of the matrix size, in an unknown state or in a cross-level gateway configuration.

A tree control allows you to monitor all the available virtual routers.

### Virtual Routers Status

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

### Interfaces

#### Dynamic interfaces

The matrix (parameter ID 50) will create the following interfaces:

- Matrix inputs will create interfaces of type *in* named *Interface In*.
- Matrix outputs will create interfaces of type *out* named *Interface Out*.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

- Between **Interface In** and **Interface Out**, connections are made automatically when crosspoints are set.
