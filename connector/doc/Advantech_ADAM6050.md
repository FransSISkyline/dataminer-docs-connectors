## About

The **Advantech ADAM6050** is an 18-ch Isolated Digital I/O Modbus TCP Module, which supports High-to-Low Delay Output. With this connector, the outputs can be set for the device.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

When you create this element, only the IP address of the host and the port need to be configured.

## Usage

### Main View page

The **Main View** page is only used to monitor the device settings. There are no write parameters.

### General page

The **General** page is similar to the Main View page, but on this page, the user can change settings for certain values.

### Configuration page

The **Configuration** page allows the user to set the **FSV** values for the different outputs. Also the **Communication WDT** and **P2P/GCL WDT** can be set. However, note that only one of the two can be *enabled* at the same time.

The set values for the FSVs and the WDT will only be set to the device when the **Apply FSV** button is clicked.

The **Host Idle Time** can also be viewed. This is the time that the host must be idle before the **FSV** values will be set to the outputs of the device.

### Backup page

The **Backup** page contains all the functionality for creating and restoring backups. When the **Create Backup** button is clicked, a backup of the current settings is made and the status of the backup is displayed. This backup will be saved in the folder *C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\DMA_COMMON_DOCUMENTS\Advantech ADAM6050*.

All backups will have a similar name. The name is formatted as follows: *\[Name of the element\]\_\[date\]\_\[time\].xml*.

It is also possible to restore the settings for the device to a backup that was taken for this type of device. There are two ways to do this: either the selected backup from the drop-down list can be restored, or the user can choose to restore the most recent backup for this type. The status of the restore will also be displayed.
