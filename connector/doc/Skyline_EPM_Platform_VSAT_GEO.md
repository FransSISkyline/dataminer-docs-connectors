# Skyline EPM Platform VSAT GEO

The **Skyline EPM Platform VSAT GEO** is an Experience and Performance Management (EPM) Manager for VSAT circuits. It aggregates data from **iDirect Evolution Platform VSAT** and **Newtec Dialog Platform VSAT** collectors, providing centralized monitoring and management through the DataMiner Topology app.

A deployed EPM VSAT Solution contains one front-end element and can have one or multiple back-end elements. The front-end element is responsible for top-level data aggregation from different back-end elements. Each back-end element is responsible for the aggregation of data from the collectors.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection - Main

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

1. **Front-end element**:

   - Set **Element Manager Type** to *Frontend*.
   - Configure the **Import** and **Export** directories for data files.

1. **Back-end elements**:

   - Set directories for importing data from the front end and exporting data to the collectors.

1. **Register IDs**:

   - Enter the necessary DMA IDs and Element IDs in the registration tables of front-end and back-end elements.

## How to Use

Once the front-end and back-end elements are created and configured, you can:

- Use the **Topology App** in DataMiner Cube to display the EPM VSAT topology chains and fields defined in the connector.
- Adjust configurations as needed using the settings on the **Configuration** page.
- Trigger the **Provision** button to start the import and export of all data files and add any new entities, notifying the back-end elements.
- Use the **Reset** button to clear existing data from tables and execute provisioning logic to correct any erroneous data.

## Topologies

- **Network**: Network, Teleport, Hub Network, Hub Return, Hub Forward, Circuit
- **Service**: Network, Customer, Customer/NMS, Circuit
- **NMS**: Network, NMS, Hub Network, Hub Return, Hub Forward, Circuit
- **Map**: Network, NMS, Customer, Customer/NMS, Circuit
- **Quick**: Type, Network
- **Infrastructure**: NMS, PP Server, Chassis, Linecards

## Notes

The workflow involves collecting data files from the collectors, assigning IDs to entities, and then distributing this data to the back-end elements for further processing. Back-end elements use the imported data to update their datasets with the assigned IDs, enabling detailed monitoring and analysis of the VSAT network.

Ensure that import/export directories are set correctly to avoid data flow issues.
