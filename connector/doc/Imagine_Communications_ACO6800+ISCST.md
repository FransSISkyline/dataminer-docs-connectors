# Imagine Communications ACO6800+ISCST

The ACO6800+ switchover module is designed for the 6800+T core processing platform and provides both the primary and backup paths critical to maintaining uninterrupted video and audio signal flow.

## About

The Clean/Quiet ACO6800+ISCST module enures that there are no abrupt relays or interruptions of video and audio signals (e.g., in the event of a cable or fiber cut) and no audible "pops" or noises when the automatic changeover takes place, restoring the integrity of the signal.

Switches signals between redundant signals at the point of ingest and ingest timing into a satellite DTH, mobile TV, or IPTV facility
