# Double D Electronics DDA89-02

The connector monitors the activity of the Double D Electronics DDA89-02 Controller.

## About

The connector has a serial communication to the Double D Electronics DDA89-02 and allows the end user to control and monitor the switches/best route configuration, plus observe the status of the device's converters.

In addition to the previous, the connector uses three timers: 1) one polling every half second for fast varying information from the controllers; 2) one polling every five seconds that retrieves general information from the device and its switches as well; and 3) one that polls every hour for slowly varying information.
