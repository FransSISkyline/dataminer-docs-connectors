# FOR-A DSK-400

The DSK-400 is a digital downstream keyer that accepts 4 background (Line) video and 4 title inputs (Fill and Key) in both 1080p (Level-A) and 1080i. It can superimpose title text over incoming video to output combined signals. A chromakey function is also available as an option.

This connector uses a serial connection over UDP/IP port to communicate with the device.
