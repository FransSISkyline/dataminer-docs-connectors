# Open Daylight Controller

OpenDaylight (ODL) is an open source framework for migrating to an SDN network architecture. It has been deployed in data center, enterprise and carrier networks, supporting a broad range of use cases. OpenDaylight provides the abstraction, programmability, and openness that paves the way towards an intelligent, software-defined infrastructure. The connector is used to send the PUT commands to the HTTP URL of the software, which in turn controls the switches of the OpenFlow in Arista Manager.

## About

The connector communicates through an HTTP protocol.
