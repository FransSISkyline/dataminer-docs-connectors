## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection - Main

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection. It is the main connection used to retrieve all the data. During element creation, it requires the following input:

**SNMP CONNECTION:**

- **IP address/host:** The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port:** The IP port of the destination.

**SNMP Settings:**

- **Get community string:** The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string:** The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

## How to use

This connector is primarily used for monitoring purposes. Across the connector, several parameters can be configured according to your preferences. Ideally, the connector should be used with alarm and trend templates to enable alarm monitoring and trending of parameters.
