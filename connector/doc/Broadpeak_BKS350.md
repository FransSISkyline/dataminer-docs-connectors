## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *8091*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Web Interface

Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.

## How to use

The element created with this connector consists of the following data pages:

- **General**: Contains general information, such as the current date and time, and the up time. Also shows the overall status of the equipment.
- **Live**: Contains a table with all live status parameters.
- **Alarm**: Shows the alarms that have occurred while the device was operational.
- **Output**: Contains a table that shows the output status along with the template name and output format.
- **Publishing**: Contains a table with all publishing status parameters.

## Notes

When you upgrade from range 1.0.0.x to 1.0.1.x, existing elements need to be reconfigured before the new connection will be taken in use.
