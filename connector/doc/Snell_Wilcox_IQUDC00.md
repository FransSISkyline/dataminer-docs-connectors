# Snell Wilcox IQUDC00

This smart-serial protocol allows to poll configuration parameters from Snell Wilcox IQUDC00 devices and to edit them.

## About

At startup, the element establishes the connection with the device and, afterwards, waits for change notifications initiated by the device for any parameter change. For this purpose, the protocol is of type "smart-serial single".

2 connections are available. The first one will be used at startup. If the first connection is lost, the element automatically switches over the second one. And if the last one is lost, the element will try to reconnect on the first one.

The communication is based on the RollCall serial protocol.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### Serial Main connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device (e.g. *127.0.0.1*).
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device. Required (default: *2050*).
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. Required (format: '\*.\*.\*'; for example: *0000.47.03*).

Serial Secondary connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device (e.g. *127.0.0.2*).
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device. Required (default: *2050*).
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. Required (format: '\*.\*.\*'; for example: *0000.47.04*).

### Configuration of element timeout time

To improve switching speed when one of the connections is lost, it is advised to set to 1 s the configuration parameter 'The element goes into timeout state when it is not responding for (sec):' in the 'Advanced element settings' section at element creation.
