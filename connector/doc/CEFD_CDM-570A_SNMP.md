# CEFD CDM-570A SNMP

The **CDM-570** is a Comtech EF Data's entry-level satellite modems and operates at L-band and includes support for externally connected Block Upconverters (BUCs) and Low-Noise Block Downcoverters (LNBs).

This connector implements the available parameters present in the device's MIB. The connector layout is implemented as much as possible like the device's web interface. There are some menus that are not present because they are not available in the MIB and there are some functions that are present in the MIB but not in the web interface.

## Usage

### Admin - Summary

This page contains the available information for the admin: Ethernet information, SNMP information and the **Host Acces List.**

### Modem

Use this page to configure the modem operating (Tx/Rx) parameters, including the Tx/Rx Interfaces and Framing. Enter a preferred value into a text box, select a predefined parameter from a drop-down menu or, for the Alarm Mask section, use the option button provided to define a designated alarm as *Masked* or *Active*.

With AUPC, a local modem is permitted to adjust its own output power level in order to attempt to maintain the Eb/N0 at the remote modem.

- **AUPC:** Use the toggle button to select AUPC operation as either *Off* or *On*.
- **Rem Demod Target Eb/N0:** Type in a value, in dB, from *0.0* to *14.9*.
- **Tx Power Max Increase:** Use the drop-down menu to select a value, in dB, from *0* to *9*.
- **Max Pwr Reached Action:** Use the drop-down menu to set the action as *No Action* or *Generate Tx Alarm*.
- **Rem Demod Unlock Action:** Use the drop-down menu to set the action as *Go to Nominal Power* or *Go to Maximum Power*.

### Modem - Utilities

Use this page to set utilities such as Date and Time and Circuit ID, and to Load or Store Configuration presets.

- **Re-Center Buffer**: To force the re-centering of the Plesiochronous/Doppler buffer.
- **Force 1:1 Switch:** to toggle the Unit Fail relay to the "fail" state for approx. 500ms. If the unit is one in a 1:1 redundant pair and it is currently the *online* unit, this forces a switchover so the unit is then placed in *standby* mode. The command is always executed by the unit, regardless of whether it is standalone, in a 1:1 pair, or part of a 1:N system.
- Load/Store Configuration: To **Load** (recall) and/or **Store** up to 10 configuration sets numbered *0* through *9*.
- Date and Time: Use the format *MM/DD/YY* to enter the **date** (where *MM = month \[01 to 12\]*, *DD = day \[01 to 31\]* and *YY = year \[00 to 99\]*).

Use the international format *HH:MM:SS* to enter the **time** (where *HH = hour \[00 to 23\]*, *MM = minutes \[00 to 59\]*, and *SS = seconds \[00 to 59\]*).

Use **Time Sync** page button to set the Time Synchronization related parameters.

- Circuit ID Configuration: Create a **Circuit ID** string of up to *24 alphanumeric characters*.

- Clocks: Configure **Tx Clock Sources**, **Rx Buffer Size**, **Modem Frequency Reference**, **G.703 Clock Extended Mode**, and **G.703 Clock Extend Interface**.

- Internal Reference:

  - **Warm Up Delay**: For internal frequency reference (OCXO). *Disabled* (instant on - no delay for OCXO to reach temperature) or *Enabled* (unit waits until OCXO reaches correct temperature)
  - **Warm Up Countdown**: Used to truncate the Warm-up delay period to zero, forcing the unit into '*instant-on*' mode. As a query, returns the Warm-up Delay countdown, in seconds remaining. Range is from 000 to 200 seconds.

- **LNB 10MHz Reference:** Enable operations *Disabled* or *Enabled*.
- Assign **LNB Current Lower** and **Current Upper Alarm Limit** values ranging from *10* to *600* mA.
- Assign an **Rx Lockout Frequency** and designate the value as a **HIGH (+)** or **LOW (**-**)** limit.

**LNB Status**: The **LNB Current** and **LNB Voltage** values displayed in this section are read-only and cannot be changed.

### IP - Interface

Use this page to view the MAC address, set the IP address and mask of the IP Module.

**Interfaces Table**

Resume and detail about the device's interfaces.

**Ethernet (LAN)**

### Dynamic Threshold

There are two parameters in the **Start Page** - **Rx Eb/No Status** and **Rx Remote Eb/No Status** - that will trigger an alarm when the values of **Rx Eb/No** and **Rx Remote Eb/No** go beyond certain values. These values are described in the **Dynamic Thresholds** Table. So, if **Rx Eb/No** and **Rx Remote Eb/No** have values under **EbNo_min** and above **EbNo_High** a *Critical Low* or *Critical High* Alarm, respectively, will be triggered. Inside the limits, **Rx Eb/No Status** and **Rx Remote Eb/No Status** will be set as *Normal*.

To define these values you need to create a file under the path "C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\DMA_COMMON_DOCUMENTS\Lineuplevels\\ with .csv extension. After that, in the **DMAElement**, press the **Refresh File List** button. The **Channels CSV-File Path** will show the name of the file. Then press **Load File**.

If device parameters **Rx Coded**, **RxModulation** and **RxFEC** are the same as the ones described in the file then a row will be shown in the table and the alarms will be set.
