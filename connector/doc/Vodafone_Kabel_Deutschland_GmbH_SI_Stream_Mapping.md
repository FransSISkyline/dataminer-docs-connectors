# Vodafone Kabel Deutschland GmbH SI Stream Mapping

This is a dedicated connector intended to store the links between DataMiner reservations, input transport stream information, and outgoing SDT/EIT PID information.

The saved data tables within the connector are required by the SRM (Service and Resource Management) framework to correctly set up the SI streams for the IP Gateway, IP Peering, and SRT Gateway use cases.
