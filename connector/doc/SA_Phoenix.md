# SA Phoenix

This protocol can monitor and control the **SA Phoenix** device, an HMS gateway that controls other HFC devices.

## About

This protocol monitors and controls an **SA Phoenix** device through SNMP calls. The information from the device is polled as follows:

- Every 12 hours for almost permanent information
- Every 30 minutes for medium to long-term information
- Every 15 minutes for short to medium-term information
- Every 10 minutes for short-term information

SNMP traps can be retrieved if this is enabled on the device.
