# Nokia TMS4

The Nokia TMS4 (Transmission Management System version 4) is a legacy device dedicated to the management of Nokia PDH network elements (NEs). These NEs may be Nokia PDH/Primary Rate transmission equipment, microwave radios or Nokia D generation equipment.

The purpose of this connector is to provide the capability to listen to printed alarm messages originating from the Nokia TMS4 via a terminal server proxy (serial-to-Ethernet (IP) converter).

### Connections

#### IP Connection

This connector uses a smart serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The IP or hostname of the destination (i.e. the terminal server that the TMS4 is connected to).
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination. (i.e. the port on the terminal server configured to relay messages to the TMS4 device).
  - **Accepted IP address:** This field can be left blank. Refer to DataMiner User Guide for more details regarding this field.

## How to use

Messages parsed by the connector will be displayed in the Alarms table on the General page:

- The connector will only display messages of type "ALARM".
- When messages of type "CANCEL" are received, the connector will automatically remove the corresponding "ALARM" message.
- Messages of type "DISTUR" are ignored and not displayed in the table.
