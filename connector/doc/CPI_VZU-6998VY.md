## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
- **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

## How to Use

The element consists of the data pages detailed below.

### Main View

Contains important information related to the device itself, e.g. High Reflected RF Fault, RF Output Power (dBm), Helix Voltage, System State.

### General Control

Contains general settings such as High Tube Temperature Alarm Trip Point, Heater Time Delay, RF Inhibit and System State.

### Control RF Output

Contains the configuration of RF output power and ALC RF output power in dBm, W, or dBW.

### Meter Query

Displays measured values such as the RF Output Power (dBm), Reflected RF, Helix Voltage and Cabinet Temperature.

### Linearizer Query

Displays linearizer values as well as offset values such as Gain, Phase Offset and Magnitude.

### Configuration

Contains configuration parameters such as Linearizer Installed, Switch System Configuration and Relay 1 Configuration.

### Status Info

Displays alarm states such as External Interlock Fault, DC Bus Fault, Helix Over Voltage Fault and BUC Fault.

The following page buttons are available:

- **Secondary Status**: Displays alarm states and settings, such as Low RF Alarm, Tube Over Temperature Alarm, CIF Control and Power Sensor Failure.
- **Summary Status**: Displays additional parameters such as ALC, W/G Switch Controller Mode, Latched Fault and Transmit Request.
- **Normalize Alarms**: Allows you to configure normalization of the RF Output Power in dBm, W and dBW, using the parameters Nominal RF Output Power (dBm), Nominal RF Output Power (W) and Nominal RF Output Power (dBW).

### Log

Allows you to retrieve a log entry and to set the Auto Log Time. For each entry, the following information is shown: Entry Date and Time, Activity Type, Log Attenuation, Log Fan Control Voltage, etc.
