### External Beacon Receiver

This page shows an overview with **monitoring** **data** and **alarms** related to the **external beacon receiver**.

### UPC

This page shows an overview with **monitoring** data, **UPC settings**, **channels** and **alarms** related to the **UPC**.

### Web Interface

This page is linked to the **web interface** of the device.

Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

**DCF** has been implemented in a different way in the **1.0.1.x** range and the **1.0.2.x** range. The **1.0.2.x** range is the preferred range to use when you want to use DCF.

### Interfaces

#### Fixed interfaces

Physical fixed interfaces:

- **Fixed Input Beacon Receiver** (in)
- **Fixed Output Beacon Receiver** (out)

#### Dynamic Interfaces

Physical dynamic interfaces:

**1.0.1.x:**

- **UPC Channel Status Overview**: Each channel represents an input/output (inout).

**1.0.2.x:**

- **UPC Channel Status Overview:**

  - Each channel will create an **input interface.**
  - Each channel will create an **output interface.**

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

- Between **Fixed Input Beacon Receiver** (in) and **Fixed Output Beacon Receiver** (out), an internal connection is created.

- **UPC Channel Status Overview**:

  - Each channel where the **UPC Channel Mode** is not *Off* is an internal connection.

## Notes

Some modules/functionalities are not implemented in the connector:

- EXP Expansion Unit
