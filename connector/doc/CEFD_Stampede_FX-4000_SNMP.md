# CEFD Stampede FX-4000 SNMP

The **CEFD Stampede FX-4000 SNMP** combines one-sided application delivery and two-sided WAN optimization into a single platform.

## About

This connector uses SNMP commands to display information and set the settings on the device. SNMP traps can be retrieved when this is enabled.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private.*

## Usage

### General

This page displays device information: **Serial Number**, **Firmware Version**, **Up Time**, **Current Time** and **License Info**. It also displays the **Service Contact** information.

### Admin

This page contains system information, including the **Host Name**, **Domain**, **DNS Server**, **Time**, **Time Zone**, and **SNMP** **Community String**, as well as the **Subnet**, **Trap State**, and **Trap Destination**.

It also contains a Web Management Interface Settings section, where you can enable or disable the **Use SSL** option, and specify the browser port used for the web interface.

### Admin Networking

On the left side of this page, you can find parameters for the **Management Interface (eth0)**: DHCP, IP Address, Mask, Gateway, Speed/Duplex MTU. On the right side, there are similar parameters for the **Auxiliary Interface (eth1)**.

The page also contains two tables: the **Static Routes** table, where you can add a route via the **Add Route** button, and the **Hosts** table, where you can also add rows.

### WANOP

This page contains the **WAN Link Settings**: TX Rate, RX Rates and Latency.

There are also parameters related to the **LAN(eth2)/WAN(eth3) Data Interfaces**: LAN Speed/Duplex, WAN Speed Duplex and LAN/WAN MTU.

### Redundancy

This page displays the **Redundancy State**, as well as the **Primary Appliance**, **Secondary Appliance** and **Authentication Key**. You can also enable or disable the parameter **Automatically Synchronize Configuration Changes**. Finally, a button is also available to synchronize the configuration, i.e. the **Sync Config** button.

### Advanced - Path Redundancy

This section contains the **Path Redundancy State** parameter, which can be enabled or disabled.

- **Connections - WANOP**: Displays the **Current** **Users** and **Max Users**, as well as the connections and passthrough connections for both **LAN** and **WAN**.
- **WAN Traffic - WANOP**: Displays the **Total Throughput**, the number of packets received by the WAN and the number of packets sent by the WAN.

At the bottom of the page, a button allows you to **Clear Statistics**.

### Statistics - Networking

This page contains the **LAN Interfaces** table, which among others displays the **States** of the interfaces, **Speed**, **MTU**, etc.

### Statistics - QoS

This page displays average statistics for a selected time period. In the **Queue Status** table, you can find the **Name** and **State** of the queues, with their **Priority**, **CIR**, **MIR**, etc.

### Statistics - Redundancy
