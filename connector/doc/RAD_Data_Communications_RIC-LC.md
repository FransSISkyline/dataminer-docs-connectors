# RAD Data Communications RIC-LC

This connector can be used to monitor RAD Data Communications RIC-LC Ethernet converters.

> [!NOTE]
> This connector has been deliberately designed to use the GetNext method to retrieve SNMP parameters. This is necessary because the device is not able to handle high traffic of requests, and this would result in device crashes.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *161*).

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

### General

The General page displays general information about the device. Two subpages are available with tables related to the **SNMP Trap** destination configuration and **NTP** servers.

### Interfaces

The Interfaces page lists the device interfaces.

### Events

The Events page contains the Alarms and Events tables. The Events table displays events with the "event" state, while the Alarms table displays all events with a "warning", "minor", "major", or "critical" state.

### SNMP Traps

This connector will receive and process SNMP traps related to interfaces and events:

- **Interfaces**: The Interfaces table will be updated upon receipt of a linkUp or linkDown trap for the specified interface.
- **Events**: The Events or Alarms table will be updated upon receipt of an event trap.
