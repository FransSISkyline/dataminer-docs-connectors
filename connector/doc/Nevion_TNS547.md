# Nevion TNS547

The TNS546 is part of the Nevion nSure product line, which provides 24/7 monitoring and advanced analysis of high-quality video content delivery. It can simultaneously monitor up to 24 MPEG-2 transport streams, although with an overall limit to the aggregate bit rate of the streams. It strongly resembles the CP545 with respect to monitoring functions, but features up to eight separate ASI inputs. In addition, it provides Ethernet inputs that will allow the monitoring of up to 16 IP-encapsulated MPEG transport streams.
