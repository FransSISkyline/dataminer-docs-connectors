## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### HTTP connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP connection:

- **IP address**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP Port**: The IP port of the destination, by default *80*.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy*.

#### SNMP connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection to receive traps and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP connection:

- **IP Address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string required to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string required to set to the device. The default value is *public*.

### Configuration

As this connector makes use of System.Web.dll, **.NET Framework 4.0** must be installed on the system for the connector to work.

## Usage

### Inputs Page

This page contains an overview of the inputs (ASI, SDI, SS2, Ethernet, TSoIP, TT2 and CC2).

Note: From version 1.1.2.6 onwards, the IDX for all the input tables can be changed via the **Input Display Key** drop-down list. The default option is *Name.Label*, but to include the custom description the option *Name.Label.Custom Description* can be selected instead.

### Transport Streams Page

This page contains an overview of all transport streams in the **Transport Streams** **table**. For each transport stream, this table shows the **Status**, **Mode**, **Total Rate**, **Effective Rate**, **TS ID**, and **ON ID**.

In addition, a number of columns in the table indicate whether a specific alarm is present for a particular transport stream (e.g. **Sync Byte Error**, **PAT Repetition Interval**, etc.).

### Services Page

This page provides an overview of all services in the **Services** **table**. For each service, this table shows the **Provider**, **Type**, **EIT Schedule Signaled**, **Scrambling Signaled**, **PMT PID**, **PCR PID**, and **Total Rate**.

In addition, a number of columns in the table indicate whether a specific alarm is present for a particular service (e.g. **PMT Missing**, **Too Many PIDs**, etc.).

### PIDS Page

This page contains information related to the PIDs. Two tables are displayed: the **PIDs** table and the **PCR PIDs** table.

The PIDs table displays an overview of all PIDs, showing among others which service each PID is part of (**Ref. by service**), and the **Type**, **Rate**, **Continuity Error Counter**, etc.

In addition, the table contains a number of columns indicating whether a specific alarm is present for a particular PID (e.g. **Unreferenced PID**, **PID Rate** **Too High**, etc.).

The PCR PIDs table contains information about the PCR PIDs, such as **Clock**, **Local Clock**, **Max Jitter**, etc.

### Alarms Page

This page displays an overview of the alarms that are currently active (and implemented by the protocol).

This device polls alarms via the HTTP interface. It also updates existing data based on incoming traps via the SNMP interface.

Via the **Filtered Alarms** page button, you can get an overview of the alarms that are currently present, but filtered in the **Filtered Alarms Table**. To process traps for filtered alarms, set the toggle button **Process Traps for Filtered Alarms** to *Yes*.

Via the **Auto Clear** page button, you can set configuration parameters for the automatic clearing of alarms in the **Alarms Table** and the **Filtered Alarms Table**. When **Max Duration Status** is set to *Enabled*, alarms that are older than the number of days specified in the **Notification Max Duration** parameter are automatically removed from the table.

Note that many alarms are related to a specific transport stream, service or PID. Therefore, for many alarms an additional column has been defined in the corresponding **Transport Streams**, **Services** or **PIDs** table. For example, for the alarm with ID 1101 ("TS unstable"), a column **TS Unstable** is defined in the **Transport Streams** **table** that indicates if this alarm is present for a particular transport stream.

### Transform

This page contains all information regarding the **TS** and **Video** **Input** **Switch**, allowing not only full monitoring, but also the configuration of every existing input.

Furthermore, this page also provides access to related **Routing** features and **RPC** calls as well as to all real-time information regarding **alarms**.
