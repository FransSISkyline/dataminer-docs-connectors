# CPI K4U74

## Important note

This connector has been reviewed and is now available as a more generic connector: **CPI KHPA Gen IV Series Binary Version**.

Please use this new updated version instead of the version detailed below.

## About

This is an obsolete connector that was used to monitor a CPI K4U74 high-power amplifier.

It uses a serial connection to monitor the state of the HPA itself and to control the waveguide switches in order to allow redundancy switching between up to 10 other HPAs.
