## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial connection - Main

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. The connector uses this to create commands. (Decimal value range: 32 to 57.)

> [!NOTE]
> The default value for *Timeout of a single command* is set to 2000 ms and the default value for *Number of retries* is set to 1.

## How to use

The **General** page displays general data retrieved from the "Get Monitor Switches" Command. It shows the positions per switch and also allows you to change the switch position.

On the **Switch Labels** page, you can configure labels for all retrieved switches and positions.

## Notes

The default value for *Timeout of a single command* is set to 2000 ms and the default value for *Number of retries* is set to 1. This setup is required because the device needs time to process sets.
