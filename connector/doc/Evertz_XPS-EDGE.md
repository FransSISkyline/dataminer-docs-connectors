## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *80*).

## How to use

The communication method of this connector is HTTP. It uses GET requests to retrieve or modify device information.

There are four different sections in this connector, which can be used for monitoring and remote orchestration.

- **General**: Displays **product** information
- **System**: Displays **network, management, monitoring,** and **security** information.
- **Encoder**: Displays the encoder **input**, **output**, and **control** information.
- **Decoder**: Displays the decoder **input**, **output**, and **control** information, as well as **monitor** data for errors and **notifications** for faults.

## Notes

All the encoder/decoder information is summarized on the **Encoders/Decoders Overview** page.
