# Ericsson MFVP

The Ericsson MFVP is a DataMiner connector for the MediaKind Controller MediaFirst Video Processing System (MFVP), a software-based, multi-application media processing platform for the content distribution market.

The MediaKind Controller manages multiple MediaKind subproducts, such as:

- MKP - MediaKind Packaging
- MKEL - MediaKind Encoding Live
- MKSP - MediaKind Stream Processor (Multiplexer)
- MDT - MediaKind Development ToolKit (Orchestration Purposes)

This connector is featured in the **Media Data Center (MDC)** project. Apart from monitoring, it can also be used to orchestrate a live encoding service joining the transcoding service and the containerized service (which supports the transcoding service) in a single DataMiner service. This feature requires **DataMiner Service & Resource Management (SRM).**

The connector is capable of fully monitoring the Ericsson MediaFirst Video Processing System, including **alarms**, **services**, **servers** and the main system **statistics**. It uses multiple REST Web APIs to send and receive data to and from the system using the JSON and XML formats.

## Configuration

### Connections - Range 1.1.0.x

This connector uses 2 HTTP connections and requires the following input during element creation.

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default = 30001).

MDT API (HTTPS):

- **IP Address/Host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP Port**: The IP port of the destination (default = 80).

### Connections - Range 1.2.0.x

This connector uses 2 HTTPS connections and requires the following input during element creation.

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: https://&lt;IP of the destination&gt;
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default = 30001).

HTTPS Connection - MDT API:

- **IP Address/host**: https://&lt;IP of the destination&gt;.
- **IP Port**: The IP port of the destination (default = 443).

For both connections to work, you will also need to go to element's Features page and specify the username and password for each connection.

Note: The ports may vary depending on the implementation.

### Connections - Ranges 1.2.1.x & 1.3.0.x

This connector uses 5 HTTPS connections and requires the following input during element creation.

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: https://&lt;IP of the destination&gt;
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default = 30001).

HTTPS Connection - MDT, STATS, CONFIG, and SOURCE APIs:

- **IP Address/host**: https://&lt;IP of the destination&gt;.
- **IP Port**: The IP port of the destination (default = 443).

For all connections to work, you will also need to go to element's Features page and specify the username and password for each connection. The credentials used for the MDT API are also used for the STATS, CONFIG, and SOURCE connection.

Note: The ports may vary depending on the implementation.

### Initialization - range 1.1.0.x

After element creation, go to the **Features** page and enable or disable the different features according to your preference.

If you encounter any issues after the element has been configured, check whether the **API Versions** parameter on the Features page matches the **supported firmware**.

### Initialization - range 1.2.0.x & 1.2.1.x & 1.3.0.x

After element creation, go to the Features page and set the username and password for both API groups.

This system implementation covers two different HTTPS interfaces with different access credentials.

- The **HTTP CONNECTION** using the **General API Credentials** has the following default credentials:

  - Username: *admin*
  - Password: *admin*

- The **HTTPS Connection - MDT API** using the **MDT API Credentials** has the following default credentials:

  - Username: *mdt-admin*
  - Password: *changeme*

NOTE: If the element is properly authenticated, but still some **400 HTTP Bad Requests** are identified in Stream Viewer, **use range 1.1.0.x** instead. In this kind of situation, an update action on behalf of the vendor is needed.

### Initialization - range 1.2.1.x

After element creation, go to the Features page and set the username and password for all three API groups.

This system implementation covers two different HTTPS interfaces with different access credentials.

- The **HTTP CONNECTION** using the **General API Credentials** has the following default credentials:

  - Username: *admin*
  - Password: *admin*

- The **HTTPS Connection - MDT API** using the **MDT API Credentials** has the following default credentials:

  - Username: *mdt-admin*
  - Password: *changeme*

- The **HTTPS Connection - STATS** using the **STATS Credentials** has the following default credentials:

  - Username: *mdt-admin*
  - Password: *changeme*

NOTE: If the element is properly authenticated, but still some **400 HTTP Bad Requests** are identified in Stream Viewer, **use range 1.1.0.x** instead. In this kind of situation, an update action on behalf of the vendor is needed.
