# Eaton IPV70B2

The **Eaton IPV70B2-EP1-10L** is a rack-mounted switched power distribution unit (ePDU) designed for datacenters that need remote site management. It provides remote power monitoring for voltage and current. The current is also displayed on a local two-digit current meter. The unit also monitors temperature and humidity.

The Switched ePDUs employ multiple configurations, available in 0U and 2U rack mount, and 42" or 66" vertical lengths. They also provide individual on/off/reboot control of up to 36 receptacles. The control interface can be customized with multiple functions and can send either SNMP traps or email alerts.

## About

This connector contains different pages with information and settings. More detailed information on these can be found in the **Usage** section of this document.

The connector uses the SNMP protocol to communicate with the device. SNMP traps can be retrieved when this is enabled on the device.

## Installation and Timing

### Creation

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (**SNMP**) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

**SNMP CONNECTION:**

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

**SNMP Settings**:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
- **Get community string**: The community string needed to read from the device.
- **Set community string**: The community string needed to set to the device.

### Timing

All data gets retrieved from the device in two ways.

- **Timers**: Regular timer that triggers every 300 seconds.
- **Traps**: When enabled and set up on the chassis, traps can be sent to DataMiner whenever an alarm occurs. The traps are accepted and processed for the ENC1 Card.
