# Optimal Satcom ECM

## About

This protocol is specifically customized to connect with a particular **database** containing information about **Carriers**, **Leases**, **Transponders** and **Satellites**.

The protocol allows you to select an **RF switch** and a **spectrum analyzer**. The main page shows a logic tree view on the left, and on the right it shows the spectrum trace corresponding with the selected tree node.

### Configuration

On this page, you can perform the database configuration.

- The **Database Source** or **Server Name** must be specified as Host\SQL Server Name.
- The **Database Port** uses the MSSQL default port by default, but a different port may be specified.
