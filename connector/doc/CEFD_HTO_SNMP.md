# CEFD HTO SNMP

The CEFD HTO SNMP connector is an SNMP connector intended to communicate with the Traffic Optimization Gateway Router devices named CEFD HTO, from Comtech.

## About

CEFD HTO devices are integrated in the Heights (CEFD H, HRX and HTO) Networking Platform, which is designed to enhance service **processing power**, **efficiency** and **intelligence**.

The most important features of the **Heights Networking Platform** are the following:

- Header and payload **compression engines** to maximize net efficiency while maintaining information integrity.
- **WAN** (Wide Area Network) **optimization** for internet traffic and **GTP** (GPRS Tunneling Protocol) **optimization** for mobile traffic, both designed to generate higher throughput and faster response time.
- **Multi-tier Quality of Service** (QoS) to ensure that the most important services and business applications are uninterrupted and continue to function properly.
- **Bandwidth and power dynamic management.**
- **Bi-directional ACM** (Adapting Code and Modulation), enabling throughput maximization depending on traffic-affecting conditions and the required SLAs (Service Level Agreements).
- **QoE** (Quality of Experience) **maximization** by providing different layers of intelligence through network design tools and powerful analytics.
